# Mini Compiler using ANTLR with Custom Instruction Support

This project is a mini compiler implemented in Java using ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition). It showcases all the major phases of compilation, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and simulated execution.

The compiler supports a simplified custom language and includes a custom instruction named `buttercup(a, min, max)`, which demonstrates how new high-level constructs can be added to a language and processed across all compilation stages.

## Overview

This compiler has been developed to illustrate the design and implementation of a language from scratch. By integrating ANTLR, the project handles parsing and grammar enforcement in a scalable and efficient manner. The phases of the compiler have been modularized for clarity and future extensibility.

---

## Motivation for the Custom Instruction

Introducing the custom instruction `buttercup` serves the following purposes:

- To demonstrate how a new language construct can be designed and implemented across all compiler phases
- To explore conditional evaluation in a more readable and compact form
- To provide an educational example of compiler extensibility and grammar modification

---

## Instruction: `buttercup(a, min, max)`

### Purpose

The `buttercup` instruction checks whether the value of a variable `a` lies within the inclusive range `[min, max]`.

### Semantics

This instruction is logically equivalent to:

```java
if (a >= min && a <= max) {
    // condition is satisfied
} else {
    // condition is not satisfied
}
```

### What's Special?

Think of `buttercup` as a *friendly bouncer* guarding the boundary of your values â€” it wonâ€™t let a number sneak past the specified range. If a variable tries to go below `min` or above `max`, `buttercup` politely tells it to back off.

It adds a readable, expressive way to enforce range checks, especially in educational code or domain-specific languages.

### Example Usage

```text
int age = 19;
buttercup(age, 18, 60);
```

This checks whether `age` is between 18 and 60.

---

## Input Format

The compiler accepts programs written in a custom simplified language. The input file should contain valid variable declarations and instruction calls.

Example `input.txt`:

```text
int a;
float b;
a = 12;
buttercup(a,1,5)
```

### Supported Syntax

- Variable declarations with optional initialization
- Custom instruction: `buttercup(a, min, max)`

All statements should be terminated properly according to the grammar rules defined in `MyLanguage.g4`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why use ANTLR?

ANTLR allows you to define grammars in a declarative way and automatically generates lexers and parsers. This simplifies the compiler construction process and supports modular, reusable code.

### What is the purpose of the `buttercup` instruction?

The `buttercup` instruction demonstrates how high-level custom instructions can be integrated into a compiler. It serves as a pedagogical tool to showcase grammar extension, semantic rule addition, and execution logic in one coherent example.

### Can I add more custom instructions?

Yes. You can extend the ANTLR grammar file and implement the corresponding semantic checks, intermediate representation, and execution behavior in the compiler.

### Does the compiler perform optimizations?

Basic or optional optimizations can be added. This version focuses primarily on demonstrating the compilation pipeline clearly.
